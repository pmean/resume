* Development of a telehealth obesity intervention for patients with MS. (Multiple Sclerosis Society, Principal Investigator: Jared Bruce) A cross-disciplinary research team is testing the effectiveness of an MS-specific weigh loss/healthy living program delivered by phone, since obesity can profoundly worsen MS severity. I am funded at 2% effort starting in October 2019, increasing to 5% effort in October 2023.

* Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NIH UL1 TR002366, Principal Investigator: Richard Barohn). The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research has been a catalyst for bringing together translational science investigators and stakeholders across the KC region, and beyond. The vision of Frontiers is to contribute to and lead national efforts to transform the way we do clinical and translational research (CTR), and to ensure research is more rapidly and more efficiently translated to the point of care so that it may contribute to improved health. I am funded at 10% effort starting in September 2017.

* Greater Plains Collaborative (PCORI HSRP20162063, Principal Investigator: Lemuel Waitman). The Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC) is a new network of 10 leading medical centers in 7 states committed to a shared vision of improving healthcare delivery through ongoing learning, adoption of evidence-based practices, and active research dissemination. Role: Consultant. I billed at an hourly rate from February 2016 to August 2017 when my efforts were switched to "Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute" described above.

* Increasing HIV Screening in African American Churches. (NIH R01 MH099981, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). The primary aim of the proposed study is to conduct a clustered, randomized community trial to fully test our culturally/religiously-tailored church-based HIV screening intervention against a standard information intervention on HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult AA church members and community members who use church outreach services. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 5% effort from July 2013 through January 2016, but had to discontinue work on this grant because of other work commitments.

* Role of cytochrome P450 in alcohol-mediated effects on antiretrovirals and HIV-1. (NIH R01 K2304028, Principal Investigator: Santosh Kumar). Our central hypothesis is that in monocytes/macrophages alcohol-mediated oxidative stress causes enhanced HIV-1 replication via pathways mediated through CYP2E1, and alcohol-mediated decrease in the efficacy of PIs and increase in PIs-mediated toxicity concurrent with increase in the rates of HIV-1 replication is directly mediated through CYP3A4. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 8% effort in the first year with increasing support in future years, but support was lost in July 2014 when the PI moved to a different institution.

* HIV Testing in African American Churches. (NIH K01 MH082640, Principal Investigator: Janette Berkley-Patton). This Mentored Research Career Award provides support for Dr. Jannette Berkley-Patton to obtain the requisite training and expertise to develop and test a church-based intervention to increase HIV testing among African Americans. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 5% effort from April 2012 through July 2013 when my efforts were switched to "Increasing HIV Screening in African Americal Churches" described above.

* Ensuring Medication Safety in Pediatric Emergencies. (FDA U01 FD004249, Principal Investigator, Susan Rahman). In no other patient population is there more calculation and manipulation of drug doses than in children. The need to individualize pediatric doses introduces the potential for errors along the entire process of drug delivery from prescribing and transcribing the dose to diluting, compounding, dispensing and administering the final formulation. Consequently, dosing errors represent the most common type of medication error in children. Error rates in children are 3x more common than the corresponding rates in adults and in hospital settings the rate of medication errors on pediatric wards is second only to those in intensive care units. Despite the abundance of weight estimation strategies, there remains a critical need for methods that are accurate across a wide range of pediatric ages, weights, lengths, nationalities and body compositions. Consequently, we undertook the development and validation of a weight estimation method that incorporates surrogates for both stature and body habitus, requires no subjective assessment and performs robustly independently of age and length over a broad range of weights. Role: Consultant I billed at an hourly rate from September 2011 through September 2012.

* Health Educators in the Emergency Department to Improve Sexual Health Care for Adolescents. (NIH KL2 RR033177 & UL1 RR033179, Principal Investigator: Melissa Miller). Our objective in this application is to develop an ED-based intervention for adolescents aged 14-19 years that will increase access to care, provide more timely detection of STIs and pregnancy, and ultimately reduce adolescents' risk for STIs and unintended pregnancies. Role: Consultant. I billed at an hourly rate from August 2011 through July 2012.

* CAM, Medical Service Utilization, and Quality of Care among Patients with Musculoskeletal Conditions (NIH R01 AT000891, Principal Investigator: Bill Lafferty). To inform health policy decision making at the individual and societal level by assessing the effect of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider use on three primary outcomes: costs, service utilization, and quality of care for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. I was funded at 25% effort from November 2010 to August 2011.

* NDNQI Services Agreement Work Order No. 3 (Principal Investigator: Nancy Dunton). Funded by the American Nurses Association. The major goals of this project are to develop a method for unit-based acuity adjustment and to develop a method to calculate hospital level indicators. I was funded at 25% effort from February through April 2008.

* Sex, SLE, and Signal Transduction (NIH R01 AR50878. Principal Investigator: Jill Jacobson). Total direct costs of $250,000 in 2002. The major goal of this project is to demonstrate that the increase in immune responsiveness to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in female mice plays a pivotal role in increased incidence of autoimmune disease. I was funded at 5% effort from December 2001 through November 2006.

* Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit (NIH U01 HD31313. Principal Investigator: Greg Kearns). Total direct costs of $361,932 in 2002. The major goal of this project is to conduct basic and translational research focusing on regulatory events in pharmacogenetics, the ontogeny of important drug metabolizing enzymes, and pharmacodynamics that will advance our understanding of age-related differences in drug disposition and action. I was funded at 3% effort from May 1996 to December 2003.
