* Faithful Response II: COVID-19 Rapid Test-to-Treat with African American Churches (U01MD018310, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton) The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored, church-based COVID-19 test-to-treat with linkage-to-care intervention condition against a non-tailored education condition on COVID-19 rapid testing rates at 6 months with adult African-American church members and the community members they serve. I am funded at 5% effort from November 2022 to October 2024.

* Impact Lead - Kansas City (HHTS20000276, Housing and Urban Development, Principal Investigator: Steve Simon). We propose a data collection effort to show that lead safe interventions can be targeted more effectively and that they can inform decisions about the choices among intervention strategies. Our first aim is to quantify the extent to which remediations to make housing lead safe by HUD standards lead to fewer lead poisoned children among those who move in. Our second aim is to develop an exterior housing-based risk index to cost effectively target homes with higher interior lead dust levels. I am funded at 13.5% effort from January 2021 through December 2024.

* Development of a telehealth obesity intervention for patients with MS. (Multiple Sclerosis Society, Principal Investigator: Jared Bruce) A cross-disciplinary research team is testing the effectiveness of an MS-specific weigh loss/healthy living program delivered by phone, since obesity can profoundly worsen MS severity. I am funded at 1.5% effort starting in October 2019, increasing to 5% effort from October 2023 through September 2024.

* COVID-19 Testing and Linkage to Care with African-American Church and Health Agency Partners (DK124664-01S1, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored, church-based COVID19 testing and linkage to care (LTC) intervention condition against a non-tailored intervention condition on COVID19 testing rates at 6 months with adult AA church members and the community members they serve. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and Socioecological Model, our community- engaged approach includes trained church leaders delivering a culturally, church-appropriate COVID19 Toolkit. Examination of LTC use and contact tracing approval will aid in understanding intervention impact on COVID19 testing by addressing participant essential needs. Potential mediators/moderators related to receipt of COVID-19 testing will be evaluated, and a process evaluation to determine implementation facilitators, barriers, and fidelity related to increasing COVID19 testing rates. I am funded at 10% effort during calendar year 2021 and 5% effort during calendar year 2022.

* Our Healthy Eastside KC (Jackson County Legislature, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). This is a community-based partnership and project to address vaccine hesitancy and health inequities in portions of Jackson County identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having exceedingly high socially vulnerable index scores. I was funded at 10% effort from June 2021 through November 2021.

* Frontiers: University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NIH 5UL1TR002366-04, Principal Investigator: Mario Castro). The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research has been a catalyst for bringing together translational science investigators and stakeholders across the KC region, and beyond. The vision of Frontiers is to contribute to and lead national efforts to transform the way we do clinical and translational research (CTR), and to ensure research is more rapidly and more efficiently translated to the point of care so that it may contribute to improved health. I was funded at 10% effort from September 2017 through June 2021.

* Preschool Development Grant Birth through Five Initiative (90TP0066-01, Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Principal Investigator: Mike Abel). We present best practices for professionals and programs across Missouriâ€™s early childhood mixed-delivery system. For more than 50 years, early childhood programs that support the growth and development of young children have been shown to have a profound impact on children over their lifespan. The challenge is to identify what elements of a high-quality early childhood program are most associated with positive outcomes for children and families. I was funded at 5% effort from September to December 2020.

* Increasing HIV Screening in African American Churches. (NIH R01 MH099981, Principal Investigator: Jannette Berkley-Patton). The primary aim of the proposed study is to conduct a clustered, randomized community trial to fully test our culturally/religiously-tailored church-based HIV screening intervention against a standard information intervention on HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult AA church members and community members who use church outreach services. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 5% effort from July 2013 through January 2016, but had to discontinue work on this grant because of other work commitments.

* Role of cytochrome P450 in alcohol-mediated effects on antiretrovirals and HIV-1. (NIH R01 K2304028, Principal Investigator: Santosh Kumar). Our central hypothesis is that in monocytes/macrophages alcohol-mediated oxidative stress causes enhanced HIV-1 replication via pathways mediated through CYP2E1, and alcohol-mediated decrease in the efficacy of PIs and increase in PIs-mediated toxicity concurrent with increase in the rates of HIV-1 replication is directly mediated through CYP3A4. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 8% effort starting in September 2013 with increasing support in future years, but support was lost in July 2014 when the PI moved to a different institution.

* HIV Testing in African American Churches. (NIH K01 MH082640, Principal Investigator: Janette Berkley-Patton). This Mentored Research Career Award provides support for Dr. Jannette Berkley-Patton to obtain the requisite training and expertise to develop and test a church-based intervention to increase HIV testing among African Americans. Role: Co-investigator. I was funded at 5% effort from April 2012 through July 2013 when my efforts were switched to "Increasing HIV Screening in African American Churches" described above.

* Ensuring Medication Safety in Pediatric Emergencies. (FDA U01 FD004249, Principal Investigator, Susan Rahman). In no other patient population is there more calculation and manipulation of drug doses than in children. The need to individualize pediatric doses introduces the potential for errors along the entire process of drug delivery from prescribing and transcribing the dose to diluting, compounding, dispensing and administering the final formulation. Consequently, dosing errors represent the most common type of medication error in children. Error rates in children are 3x more common than the corresponding rates in adults and in hospital settings the rate of medication errors on pediatric wards is second only to those in intensive care units. Despite the abundance of weight estimation strategies, there remains a critical need for methods that are accurate across a wide range of pediatric ages, weights, lengths, nationalities and body compositions. Consequently, we undertook the development and validation of a weight estimation method that incorporates surrogates for both stature and body habitus, requires no subjective assessment and performs robustly independently of age and length over a broad range of weights. Role: Consultant I billed at an hourly rate from September 2011 through September 2012.

* Health Educators in the Emergency Department to Improve Sexual Health Care for Adolescents. (NIH KL2 RR033177 & UL1 RR033179, Principal Investigator: Melissa Miller). Our objective in this application is to develop an ED-based intervention for adolescents aged 14-19 years that will increase access to care, provide more timely detection of STIs and pregnancy, and ultimately reduce adolescents' risk for STIs and unintended pregnancies. Role: Consultant. I billed at an hourly rate from August 2011 through July 2012.

* CAM, Medical Service Utilization, and Quality of Care among Patients with Musculoskeletal Conditions (NIH R01 AT000891, Principal Investigator: Bill Lafferty). To inform health policy decision making at the individual and societal level by assessing the effect of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider use on three primary outcomes: costs, service utilization, and quality of care for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. I was funded at 25% effort from November 2010 to August 2011.

* NDNQI Services Agreement Work Order No. 3 (Principal Investigator: Nancy Dunton). Funded by the American Nurses Association. The major goals of this project are to develop a method for unit-based acuity adjustment and to develop a method to calculate hospital level indicators. I was funded at 25% effort from February through April 2008.

* Development of a Sperm Morphology Standard (NIH R43 HD044383. Principal Investigator: Susan Rothmann). Total direct costs of $137,349 in 2003. Infertility affects an estimated ten million Americans annually. A critical "gateway" diagnostic test used in over 10,000 USA labs is sperm morphology, one of the most predictive measures of fertility potential that often determines the course of clinical intervention. Morphology also is an important measure of toxic exposure from environmental and occupational sources. Unfortunately, morphology analysis often is the most unreliable and difficult part of a semen profile to interpret, due primarily to lack of a useful Standard. Several schemes exist, none of which have adequate agreement among laboratories. The goal of the proposal is to determine the feasibility of developing a consensus Standard for sperm morphology associated with reproducible visual and morphometric characteristics. I was funded as a consultant on an hourly basis from May 2003 through November 2004.

* Sex, SLE, and Signal Transduction (NIH R01 AR50878. Principal Investigator: Jill Jacobson). Total direct costs of $250,000 in 2002. The major goal of this project is to demonstrate that the increase in immune responsiveness to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in female mice plays a pivotal role in increased incidence of autoimmune disease. I was funded at 5% effort from December 2001 through November 2006.

* Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit (NIH U01 HD31313. Principal Investigator: Greg Kearns). Total direct costs of $361,932 in 2002. The major goal of this project is to conduct basic and translational research focusing on regulatory events in pharmacogenetics, the ontogeny of important drug metabolizing enzymes, and pharmacodynamics that will advance our understanding of age-related differences in drug disposition and action. I was funded at 3% effort from May 1996 to December 2003.
