* Full Professor, part-time, Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), February 2009 to present. In this position, I started the Research and Statistical Consult Service. With a second consultant, we helped with the planning of research studies, analyzed the data coming from these studies, and co-authored research presentations and publications. We helped researchers obtain internal and external grant funding. I left work with the Research and Statistical Consult Service in January 2016 because of the demands of a major research grant, but the service is still being run by another faculty member. In addition to this work, I helped with the introduction of a new Master's degree in Bioinformatics and a graduate certificate in clinical research. I helped develop three new courses (Introduction to R, Introduction to SAS, and Introduction to SPSS) including the preparation of materials for an online version of these classes. I have provided guest lectures for other classes (Responsible Conduct of Research, Clinical Trials).

* Independent Statistical Consultant, P.Mean Consulting, July 2008 to present. In this position, I have provided consulting on research design and data analysis to clients. I have specialized in helping doctoral students who are struggling with the requirements of their dissertations. I have provided webinar classes for The Analysis Factor, Novartis, and the Medical Library Association. When I first started my consulting business, I could not find much information about the practical aspects of statistical consulting (e.g., contracts, insurance, and billing), so I developed resources on my website and blog and gave presentations and short courses on setting up a consulting practice.

* Research Biostatistician, Office of Medical Research, The Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics (CMH), May 1996 to October 2008, with a joint appointment as Associate Professor (promoted to Full Professor, September 2007) in the School of Medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In this position, I provided statistical consulting to the doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals at CMH. Before I arrived, there was no statistical support for researchers, so I developed a consulting system from scratch. This included a series of training classes that helped researchers to become self-sufficient for some of their less complex data analyses. I wrote some informational handouts for clients and placed these on my web (now at www.pmean.com). It started slowly, but averaging one or two handouts per week, I now have a website that has over 1300 pages (over 1600 if you count my blog, blog.pmean.com, started in 2013). This website is regularly cited in both paper and electronic resources for research methodology and pops up high on the list of search engines when technical terms in research are entered. I helped many researchers get funding (both internal and external) through research grants. I worked closely with the Institutional Review Board to ensure that protocols submitted to them addressed concerns about scientific merit and protection of confidentiality. I provided training in the ethical conduct of research. I worked closely with the effort to implement Evidence Based Health Care at CMH and participated in numerous journal clubs. In 2006, I published a book on the statistical issues associated with critical appraisal of research evidence. I was the sole statistician at CMH from 1996 to 2007 and oversaw a massive expansion in the quantity and quality of research conducted there.

* Chief, Statistics Activity, Division of Biomedical and Behavioral Science, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, December 1987 to May 1996. I supervised a staff of two research statisticians and two computer specialists. I oversaw the administration of a Local Area Network for more than 100 users, and the maintenance of administrative and research data on a client-server database. I reviewed and approved all project protocols in the Division prior to the start of any experimental work. I worked directly with project officers in designing experiments, analyzing data, and writing results for publication. I was very active in the NIOSH effort to adopt Total Quality Management (TQM), serving as team leader, facilitator, or member of a variety of quality teams. I provided many informal training seminars in TQM for NIOSH employees. 

* Research Statistician, Division of Biomedical and Behavioral Science, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, July 1987 to November 1987. The person who hired me for this position left shortly after I arrived and I was quickly promoted to her position (see above).

* Assistant Professor, Department of Applied Statistics and Operations Research, Bowling Green State University, September 1981 to May 1987. Duties included teaching and research. I taught Business Statistics, Experimental Design, Linear Models, Multivariate Statistics, Nonparametric Statistics, Regression, and Statistical Packages. I published articles and made presentations in the areas of numerical accuracy, robust statistics, and computer applications. During the Summer of 1986, I served as the Assistant Director of the Statistical Consulting Center. 

* Adjunct Instructor, Department of Statistics, University of Iowa, June to August 1981. I taught a three credit hour class, Statistical Computing.

* Research Assistant, Statistical Consulting Center, University of Iowa, June 1979 to August 1981. I was the student director of the Statistical Consulting Center. Under the direction of a faculty adviser, I met with faculty and graduate students and provided guidance and support for the design of research studies and the analysis of the data from those studies.
