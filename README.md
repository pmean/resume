# resume

This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown to create
a reasonably clean and simple version of my resume.

There are two versions:

+ a [short resume][sim3] which only lists the most recent activities, and
+ a [longer resume][sim4] which lists everything back to my college days.

I also have included a [recent biosketch][sim5]. This has a specialized format and is produced using Microsoft Word.

If you are unfamiliar with github, it cannot easily display binary files like pdf and Word. You need to find and click on the download button on the right hand side of these pages.

Notice to headhunters: I appreciate and am flattered by your attention, but please don't waste your time here. I am not looking for new employment and I will ignore any inquiries that you might send. I post my resume here mostly to help out my various research collaborators.
